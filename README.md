1:  OpenGL animation:  Moving Target.
    ~A small program that animates a wheel as well as multiple "arrows" made of GL_LINES.

2:  Arm Emulator Planning Document:
    ~ A plan for implementing features into an ARM emulator for a senior project.(Group Effort)

3: Arm Usability Study:
    ~I provided sample materials to a focus group composed mostly of people who are not in the computer science field.  This document's purpose was to record how each member of both groups reacted to the materials I presented to them, and how these people imagined the use of the product in question would work.



4: "Lupin the Third" Theme Song Jazz Band Arrangement
~Unrelated to computer science:  I had spent 3/4 of my time at The University of Mary Washington with the UMW Jazz Ensemble.  I decided that for my last semester with the group, I would "attempt" to arrange a score for the theme song of an older Japanese animation: Lupin III (Lupin the Third).  This was in collaboration with one of the music faculty at the University.  Separate parts (for each instrument in the band at that time) are stored in a zip file.

5:  Results page of a Schelling Cellular Automata Model:  Writeup included.


Due to preserving the integrity of the Honor Code at the University of Mary Washington, as well as other Universities, I will not directly post code onto GitHub.
