1:  OpenGL animation:  Moving Target.
    ~A small program that animates a wheel as well as multiple "arrows" made of GL_LINES. This was created for a 400 level college course elective.  This program was important in introducing me to the handling of graphical objects and controlling their position on screen.  If the time is presented, I would love to recreate this with 3-dimensional objects (which I have learned)

2:  Arm Emulator Planning Document:
    ~ A plan for implementing features into an ARM emulator for a senior project.(Group Effort) This document was vital in creating guidlines for an organized approach and allowed the implementation team to organize thoughts on a plan of creating the Arm Emulator in question.  In the scheduling section, I would have liked to add compensation for outside obstructions to the expected due dates of different tasks.

3: Arm Usability Study:
    ~I provided sample materials to a focus group composed mostly of people who are not in the computer science field.  This document's purpose was to record how each member of both groups reacted to the materials I presented to them, and how these people imagined the use of the product in question would work.  I do not see myself wanting to have done anything additional with this study, as it fit quite well with the production phase of the ARM Emulator at that moment in time.



4: "Lupin the Third" Theme Song Jazz Band Arrangement
~Unrelated to computer science:  I had spent 3/4 of my time at The University of Mary Washington with the UMW Jazz Ensemble.  I decided that for my last semester with the group, I would "attempt" to arrange a score for the theme song of an older Japanese animation: Lupin III (Lupin the Third).  This was in collaboration with one of the music faculty at the University.  Separate parts (for each instrument in the band at that time) are stored in a zip file.
This was important to me because, as a musician, I enjoy playing music.  I have always accepted any score that would be handed to me in the school Jazz ensembles that I have performed with.  I wanted to delve into the act of arranging for an ensemble.  This presented many different issues other than knowing the different audible parts of the song.  This involved knowing exactly how many instruments are present in the ensemble, and creating a balance that would produce a nice and complementary sound that is suited to the size and abilities of each section (Saxophones, Brass, Rythem).  
If I were to re attack this project, I would consider rewriting the rythem parts to be more general.  At a college level performance  and beyond,  it is common to see a  road map for the patterns of notes played in the Rythem section.  This would be accompanied by key changes that would set the rule for what notes to be played.

5:  Results page of a Schelling Cellular Automata Model:  Writeup included.
This was a project made for a College level course elective on the subject of modeling and simulation.  I found this program to be important in simulating the behavioral patterns of different cells that had a preference to co existing with cells of "like-color".  If I were to add on to this program, I would like to implement an additional nested for-loop that would introduce a plague of some kind.(I would like to make this program as complex as possible).

Due to preserving the integrity of the Honor Code at the University of Mary Washington, as well as other Universities, I will not directly post code onto GitHub.
